# Module-1: Redux-Bootstrap

## Introduction 

In this module, we will be building a simple counter application using Redux. We will also be using Tailwind CSS for styling and React for the frontend. This module will help you understand how to use Redux in a React application.

## Description

The counter application will have a button to increment and decrement the count. The count will be displayed on the screen. The application will also have a Redux store to manage the state of the application. We will use the Redux Toolkit for managing the state.
